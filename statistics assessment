# a SCRIPT FOR STATISTICS ASSESSMENT
#question1 
# a function to calculate mean of 3 numbers
#first, create user defined function
myfn <- function(a,b,c){
  result <- ((a+b+c)/3)
  print(result)
}

# calculate the mean of values 2,4 and 6 as a demo
myfn(2,4,6)

#question2
#load female mice data

data <- read.csv("femaleMiceWeights.csv", header = TRUE)

# See the first five lines of the dataset
head(data)

# calculate the overal mean and variation for the two diets
mean(data$Bodyweight)

Mean = 25.32375

#calculate variation among all mice
var(data$Bodyweight)

#var = 14.78

# calculate the mean and variation for specific diets used

# mean for chow diet
chow <- mean(data[1:12,2])

# Sd for chow diet
chow <- sd(data[1:12,2])

#chow diet sd = 3.022541


# mean for hf diet
hf <- mean(data[13:24,2])

#hf diet mean =  26.83417

# sd for hf diet
hf <- sd(data[13:24,2])

#hf diet sd = 4.097606
